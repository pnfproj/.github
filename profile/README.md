# Personalized News Feed

## About

Traditionally, AI-powered personalized news feeds have been closed-sourced. With a few exceptions, there have been no AI-powered open-sourced personalized news feeds.

This project strives to bring personalized news feeds to the open-source community, promoting transparency and data privacy.

Although our system is still in alpha and far from complete, we’re planning to improve it to make training and usage easier, faster, and more efficient.

## Join the Beta

We’re planning to open a beta waitlist in the near future. If you want to beta-test PNF, please [register your interest](https://rdr.fyi/pnfbeta). Eventually, we plan to open source our model to allow maximum transparency and allow the community to contribute.

**We'll consider open-sourcing once we get over 100 responses to our form**
